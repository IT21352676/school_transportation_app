# 1. Introduction
   
The School Transport Management System (STMS) is a concept developed to prevent 
communication failure, improve efficiency, address safety concerns and improve the transport 
service in schools. It is to be implemented at Oruwala Primary School in Sri Lanka to link the 
parents, students and transport service provider together in one system. This system is able to 
collect real time data, uses QR code to scan and mark the Check in and Check out, has an alert 
system to bus locations and late issues, and more. This is to increase the safety of the students and 
at the same time reduce the workload of the school management. It also has the ability to modify 
the route to enhance the performance, decrease the fuel usage and decrease the carbon footprint of 
the school.
Based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that with the right human and financial 
resources, teamwork among teachers and coordination with other stakeholders, STMS is likely to 
enhance the school transport delivery. Also, since it is user friendly and has a provision for 
upgrading, it is applicable for implementation in schools. However, more work has to be done to 
establish whether or not it is cost-effective and easy to implement in various schools.
